'''
Baseline correction module
--------------------------

This module contains functions for determination the base line
of experimental data (e.g. UV/VIS spectrum). The base line is obtained
by iterative removing the high frequency signal and interpolating
the remaining points by the spline method.

    """Calculates the baseline of the input data *y* using an iterative removing
    of the high frequency signal. The method is based on application of moving
    average smoothing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : 1-D list/array
        array of independent input data. Must be increasing.
    y : 1-D list/array
        array of dependent input data, of the same length as *x*.
    wpn : int
        Number of the adjacent values of *y* averaged. *wpn* must be an odd
        number.
    noise : float or 1-D numpy.array
        Estimated noise level of the data in the *y* array. If *noise*
        is an array, it must be of the same length as x (x-dependent noise).
    rem : float
        During the calculation the elements of *y* containing the high
        frequency signal are removed iteratively. The iterations are stopped
        when the number of the remining elements in the *y* is equal or lower
        then lenx*(1. - rem), where lenx is the original length
        of the *y* array.
    k : int
        Degree of the smoothing spline. Must be <= 5. Default is k=1,
        a linear spline.
    fulloutput : bool
        Influences the output (see the *Returns* section).
        Default value is *False*.
    cbfun : callable/None, optional *cbfun(b_inds, ma, \*cbfunargs)*
        A callback function executed at the end of each iteration
        (*cbfun(b_inds, ma, *cbfunargs)*),
        where *b_inds* is an numpy.array containing the actual indexes
        of the array *y* which are used to construct the baseline,
        *ma* is an array of smoothed values of *y* corresponding to the indexes
        in the *b_inds* array
    cbfunargs : tuple, optional
        Extra positional arguments passed to *cbfun*
    remrate : float
        A number in (1,inf> range (reasonable values are
        between 1.05 and 3). The higher is the value the more signal points
        are removed during one iteratoion (default value is equal to 1.5)

    Returns
    -------
    If *fulloutput* is *True*, returns a numpy.array of the same length as *x*
    containing the *y* data base line, the instance of the *scipy.interpolate.
    fitpack2.LSQUnivariateSpline* class and an numpy.array of the indexes
    of *y* corresponding to the base line with the high frequency
    signal removed.

    Else returns a numpy.array of the same length as *x* containing
    the *y* data base line."""
